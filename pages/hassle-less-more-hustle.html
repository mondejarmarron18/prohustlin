          Hustling is a slang word meant to describe the action of working
          excessively to achieve goals. Don't take this negatively! The new
          generation seeks to retire early and enjoy the fruits of their labour.
          Nobody is no longer waiting until they're 60 to retire. It is more
          like taking advantage of the vigour of youth while it's still full.
          <br /><br />
          Hustle more now for a hassle-less future.
          <br /><br />
          Gen Z's have experienced a challenging childhood with some parents
          barely making it paycheck-per-paycheck and going through food stamps
          to survive. Witnessing the death of loved one's caused by sedentary
          lifestyles. Survival is part of human nature, but so is becoming the
          fittest of them all. Gen Z's are through with only surviving. They
          want a better and longer life with peace, good health, and financial
          freedom on a different level.
          <br /><br />
          Elon Musk and other billionaires glorify the hustle culture with their
          current lifestyle - usually explaining how they're relaxing now
          because of their sacrifices when they were just starting. Basically,
          sacrifice on sleep and socialization, barely sleeping through the
          night, and not going out for dinners or parties.
          <br /><br />
          With the pandemic, health professionals are encouraging many to
          prioritize physical and mental health. Physical health should be
          improved by becoming conscious of what to eat and having a longer
          sleeping time. This concept contradicts the hustle culture. However,
          the hustle has shifted to seeking balance in hard work. As hustling is
          used to describe hard work, it shouldn't single out the thought of
          only working hard to earn money. Goals can also be seeking a healthier
          and sustainable lifestyle.
          <br /><br />
          Hustle more now on becoming healthy for a hassle-less future.
          <br /><br />
          Making conscious decisions on what to eat and when to exercise will
          minimize health risks in the future. Imagine what a hassle to spend
          all your earnings on endless medical bills because you chose an
          unhealthy lifestyle now. It will only take at least 25-30 minutes
          three times a week of exercise to maintain a healthy body in the
          future. It should also be paired with making healthy food options by
          simply following the food pyramid.
          <br /><br />
          Hustle more now on improving your mindset and character for a
          hassle-less future.
          <br /><br />
          Change is inevitable, and it is the key to growth. It is vital to
          constantly assess ourselves and make changes for improvement. Hustling
          now to improve ourselves will save us from hassle in the future, such
          as making financial decisions - saving and purchasing. Maintaining a
          sustainable lifestyle doesn't limit our spending. It is just being
          wise when spending, which is saving. Learning materials about
          financial literacy are abundant on the internet - learn them! It only
          takes reading and application of learning to maintain a sustainable
          lifestyle in the future. Spend wisely and save abundantly.
          <br /><br />
          As a famous quote says, "I don't make excuses. I make results."
          <br /><br />
          If you've reached this point of the blog, you are bound to the
          challenge of making your own hustle. Keep in mind to hustle for
          betterment. Start now!
